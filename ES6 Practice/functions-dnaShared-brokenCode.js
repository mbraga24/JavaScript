/*
DESCRIPTION / OBJECTIVE

We expect the number passed in to always be an integer from 0 to 100, but for some reason it's not working!

Here's how it's supposed to calculate the relationship:
100 should return 'You are likely identical twins.'
35-99 should return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
14-34 should return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and neice/nephew, or half siblings.'
6-13 should return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
3-5 should return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
1-2 should return 'You are likely 3rd cousins.'
0 should return 'You are likely not related.'
*/

const whatRelation = percentSharedDNA => {
    if (percentSharedDNA === 100) {
        return 'You are likely identical twins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 34) {
        return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 13) {
        return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 5) {
        return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 2) {
        return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 0) {
        return 'You are likely 3rd cousins'
    }
    return 'You are likely not related.'
}

console.log(whatRelation(34)) // 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
console.log(whatRelation(3);  // 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
